      In this section I will list all of the <AccentMono>Latex</AccentMono> materials 
      I created to study for my University courses. 
      Most of the books available are in Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹,
       and some of them are hand written.  
       <Accent> I take no responsibility on the information and data wrote in these materials. </Accent>
       The notes will not be updated and are all related to the academic year <AccentMono>2021/2022</AccentMono>.
        Some notes have some bonus chapters for updates with <AccentMono>2022/2023</AccentMono>  course notes.

      personal explanation of some concepts. Text in <AccentCustom color={"red"}>red</AccentCustom> is used for titles and sections. <AccentCustom color={"blue"}>  blue</AccentCustom> is used to note further details about specific topics or theorems. 
      The handwritten and hybrid notes are not print-ready,
